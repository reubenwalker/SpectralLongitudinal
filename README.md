> **‚ÄúRetrospective Longitudinal Analysis of Spectral Features Reveals Divergent Vocal Development Patterns for Treble and Non-Treble Singers‚Äù**

---

## üìÑ Abstract

This study investigates the **longitudinal spectral development** of male and female classical singers throughout conservatory training. While classical singing techniques share commonalities across voice types, physiological differences have led to gender-specific pedagogy. Previous acoustic research has explored differences in resonance strategies between genders and voice types; however, **little is known about how these spectral characteristics develop during vocal training**.

In this **retrospective longitudinal study**, recordings from **117 classical voice students** at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik Carl Maria von Weber Dresden (2008‚Äì2018) were analyzed across their four-year bachelor studies. 

Voice types were grouped as:
- **Treble voices**: sopranos, mezzo-sopranos, altos, and countertenors  
- **Non-treble voices**: tenors, baritones, and basses

Spectral measures were derived from three vocal exercises using **Long-Term Average Spectrum (LTAS)**, and analyzed using **linear mixed-effects models** to assess changes over time by voice group.

**Key findings**:
- Treble singers increased relative acoustic energy in the **fundamental frequency (f‚ÇÄ)** range.
- Non-treble singers increased acoustic energy **above 1000 Hz**.
- Female singers exhibited **increased vocal periodicity** over time, suggesting reduced breathiness.

## How to Run the Code

### R Analysis

1. Open `analysis.Rmd` in RStudio.
2. Ensure the working directory is set automatically (e.g., via `rstudioapi` if applicable).
3. Ensure all required R packages are installed (`lme4`, `ggplot2`, etc.).
4. Knit the document to PDF or HTML.

### Python Script

To run the LTAS analysis separately:
Navigate to folder with audio files with naming convention in the form:
audioID&YYYY_MM_DD&test1.wav
Where 
test1: Medium Sustained Phonation
test2: Sustained triad 
test4: Messa di voce
test6: Avezzo a vivere 

```bash
python JASA_scripts_Final.py
